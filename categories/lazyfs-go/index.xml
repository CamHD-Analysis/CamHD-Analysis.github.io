      <description>I found myself with lots of time to think and very little time to program in December. This was good as I think my understanding of the CamHD problem evolved over that time, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to really start sketching out ideas.
I realized one of my mental blocks was choice of languages. Tim works in Python. I don&amp;rsquo;t know Python (at least not well enough to really do a good job starting from scratch), preferring Ruby for my scripting needs and C/C++ for compiled languages.</description>
