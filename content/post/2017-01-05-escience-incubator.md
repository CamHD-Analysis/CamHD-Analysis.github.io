title: Winter 2017 eScience Incubator
---

My (Aaron's) contribution to this project has been accepted for the 2017 [UW eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu/) [Winter 2017 Incubator](https://github.com/uwescience/incubator2017).   It's the first day in the office for this ten week program and I'm meeting the other participants.

Besides the technical support from the eScience analysts on image processing, data handling and cloud compute, I'm really looking forward to being forced to explain and justify my design decision in detail.   Working by myself, I miss the opportunity for design review.

As a first assignment, we've [chartered](https://github.com/uwescience/incubator2017/wiki/Cloud-Enabled-Tools-for-CamHD-Visual-Analysis) our incubator projects.
