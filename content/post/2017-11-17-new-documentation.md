title: Improvements to CamHD_Motion_Metadata documentation
---

I've recently hired a couple of UW [Masters of Data Science](https://www.datasciencemasters.uw.edu) students to help
me clean up the code.   Nothing like a fresh set of eyes to find all of the
crazy idiosyncracies I've introduced to the process.

As part of that, I've been trying to clean up the documentation in [CamHD_motion_metadata](https://github.com/CamHD-Analysis/CamHD_motion_metadata/tree/master/docs)
including a [new description of the full processing chain.](https://github.com/CamHD-Analysis/CamHD_motion_metadata/blob/master/docs/Twenty_Thousand_Foot_View.md)
