title: eScience Winter Incubator Mid-term Checkin
---

Just finished my [eScience Winter Incubator](https://github.com/uwescience/incubator2017) mid-term checkin.   It was great to hear what everyone else is up to.

I've attached my slides below (FWIW), and see [Nick's notes.](https://github.com/uwescience/incubator2017/wiki/Aaron's-midterm-presentation:-Cloud-Enabled-Tools-for-the-Analysis-of-Subsea-HD-Camera-Data)
