As part of our mission to provide tools for processing CamHD video data, we've established a [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) instance which has a local copy of a subset of the full HD (uncompressed ProRes) CamHD video.

Please see the landing page [HERE](https://chiron.ldeo.columbia.edu).
